# Technical Debt Assessment and Remediation Plan for simplenote_mcp/server/server.py

## 1. Documented Technical Debt

### a. Global Variables

- Use of `global` for `simplenote_client`, `note_cache`, and `background_sync` leads to maintainability and concurrency issues.
- These globals make testing and refactoring harder.

### b. Error Handling

- Inconsistent error handling; some blocks catch broad exceptions, others are too narrow or missing.
- Error messages are sometimes generic or duplicated.

### c. Code Duplication

- Initialization logic for cache and Simplenote client is repeated in multiple places.
- Patterns for checking and initializing resources are not DRY.

### d. Logging

- Logging is verbose and sometimes redundant.
- Some log messages are not actionable or are repeated.

### e. Dependency Management

- No explicit dependency management or checks for required packages.
- No requirements.txt or pyproject.toml update for new/changed dependencies.

### f. Testing Coverage

- No clear separation of concerns for easier unit testing.
- Logic is tightly coupled, making mocking and testing difficult.

### g. Performance

- Cache and background sync initialization can be redundant or inefficient.
- No clear strategy for avoiding race conditions or startup delays.

## 2. Prioritization of Improvements

| Priority | Area                | Impact         | Complexity |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|------------|
| High     | Global Variables    | High          | Low        |
| High     | Error Handling      | High          | Low        |
| High     | Code Duplication    | High          | Medium     |
| Medium   | Logging             | Medium        | Low        |
| Medium   | Testing Coverage    | Medium        | Medium     |
| Medium   | Performance         | Medium        | Medium     |
| Low      | Dependency Mgmt     | Low           | Low        |

## 3. Recommendations

### a. Refactoring Strategies

- Encapsulate global state in a singleton or context object.
- Move repeated initialization logic into helper functions or classes.
- Use dependency injection for easier testing.

### b. Error Handling

- Standardize error handling with custom exceptions and clear messages.
- Avoid catching broad `Exception` unless necessary; prefer specific exceptions.

### c. Code Readability

- Add docstrings and comments for complex logic.
- Use type hints consistently.
- Remove commented-out or dead code.

### d. Testing Coverage

- Refactor logic into smaller, testable functions.
- Add unit tests for cache, client initialization, and tool handlers.

### e. Performance

- Ensure cache and background sync are initialized only once.
- Use async patterns and locks to avoid race conditions.

### f. Dependency Management

- Add or update `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` to reflect actual dependencies.
- Use virtual environments for isolation.

## 4. Next Steps

- Begin by refactoring global variables and deduplicating initialization logic.
- Standardize error handling and logging.
- Modularize code for improved testability.
- Document all changes and add TODOs for future improvements.
