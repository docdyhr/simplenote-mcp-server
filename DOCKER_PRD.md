# Docker Technical Requirements for MCP Server Container

This document outlines the technical requirements for containerizing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, specifically for the Simplenote MCP server, to be included in a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

## 1. Containerization Requirements

### 1.1 Docker Image Specifications

- Base image should be lightweight and appropriate for the runtime environment (e.g., `node:20-slim` for Node.js applications)
- Multi-architecture support required (x86_64 and ARM64)
- Final image size should be optimized (<500MB preferred)
- No unnecessary packages or dependencies should be included
- Proper versioning using semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0)

### 1.2 Docker Configuration

- Proper `WORKDIR` definition
- Non-root user execution for security
- Appropriate port exposure (default: 8000)
- Volume configuration for persistent data (if applicable)
- Health check implementation
- Defined entry point and default command
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Proper logging configuration

## 2. MCP Protocol Compliance

### 2.1 Protocol Support

- Must fully implement Model Context Protocol specification
- Support for all required MCP endpoints:
  - `tools/list`
  - `tools/execute`
  - `resources/list`
  - `resources/get`
- Implementation of proper error handling and status codes
- Support for standard MCP transports (HTTP+SSE and/or stdio)

### 2.2 MCP Server Metadata

- Clear and descriptive tool and resource definitions
- Comprehensive documentation in tool descriptions
- Proper categorization of tools/resources
- Standardized response formatting

## 3. Security Requirements

### 3.1 Container Security

- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Support for Docker Secrets for credential management
- Minimal container permissions
- Proper isolation from host system
- Regular security scanning of base images
- Vulnerability monitoring and patching process

### 3.2 Authentication & Authorization

- Support for OAuth 2.1 framework for authentication (for HTTP transport)
- Implementation of proper access controls
- Rate limiting implementation
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- Audit logging for security events

## 4. Performance Requirements

### 4.1 Resource Allocation

- Defined CPU limits and requests
- Defined memory limits and requests
- Identified storage requirements
- Network bandwidth considerations
- Graceful degradation under load

### 4.2 Scalability

- Stateless design where possible
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Load balancing support
- Connection pooling for database access (if applicable)

## 5. Integration Requirements

### 5.1 Docker MCP Toolkit Compatibility

- Compatible with Docker MCP Toolkit extension
- One-click setup capability with popular MCP clients

- Compatibility with the `docker mcp` CLI

### 5.2 MCP Client Support

- Verified compatibility with Claude
- Verified compatibility with Docker AI Agent (Gordon)
- Verified compatibility with other popular MCP clients (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)
- Clear configuration examples for all supported clients

## 6. Documentation & Metadata Requirements

### 6.1 Container Documentation

- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- Clear environment variable documentation
- Sample docker-compose configuration
- Troubleshooting guide
- Contribution guidelines

### 6.2 Docker Hub Metadata

- Comprehensive description
- Example usage

- License details
- Tags and labels for searchability

## 7. Testing Requirements

### 7.1 Container Tests

- Automated build testing
- Container startup testing
- Container health check testing
- Resource utilization testing
- Security scanning

### 7.2 MCP Protocol Tests

- Tool functionality tests

- Stress/load testing
- Integration testing with major MCP clients

## 8. Maintenance Requirements

### 8.1 Update Procedures

- Defined update process for base images
- Dependency management strategy
- Versioning strategy
- Backward compatibility policy
- Deprecation policy for older versions

### 8.2 Monitoring & Observability

- Container health metrics
- Log output standardization
- Performance metrics collection
- Integration with monitoring tools
- Alerting capabilities

## 9. License & Compliance Requirements

### 9.1 Licensing

- Compatible open source license (e.g., MIT)
- Proper license documentation
- Attribution for third-party components
- License compatibility verification

### 9.2 Compliance

- Data privacy compliance considerations
- Export control compliance
- Appropriate disclaimers and warnings
- Usage restrictions documentation

## 10. Simplenote-Specific Requirements

### 10.1 API Integration

- Secure handling of Simplenote API tokens
- Proper error handling for API rate limits
- Efficient caching of Simplenote data
- Support for all required Simplenote operations

### 10.2 Feature Requirements
